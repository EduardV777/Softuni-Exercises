<h1>1. How is this repository structured?</h1>
<h4>Each folder in this repository represents a different language I have studied at the coding academy. Each subfolder within them represents a different stage of the whole course in that language. Folders within the subfolders represent each different topic and the respective code files.
Lab folders contain codes written together with a lecturer, while 'Exercise' folders are codes written on my own and tested using the academy's Judge system for automatic testing.</h4>
